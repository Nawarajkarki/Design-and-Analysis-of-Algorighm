# Design and Analysis of Algorithms

### Welcome to the **Design and Analysis of Algorithms** repository! 
This repository is a treasure trove of Python programs that demonstrate various algorithms taught in the “Design and Analysis of Algorithms” course, a key subject in the CSIT curriculum.

Whether you’re a CSIT student delving into this subject or an algorithm enthusiast exploring new techniques, this repository offers a wide range of well-documented algorithms for you to learn from and experiment with. Enjoy your journey through the fascinating world of algorithms!

## Algorithms
### The algorithms covered in this repository are:
- Searching algorithms:
    - Linear search
- Sorting algorithms:
    - Bubble sort
    - Insertion sort
    - Selection sort
- Divide & Conquer Algorithms:
    - Merge sort
    - Quick sort


## Installation
To run the programs in this repository, you need to have Python 3 installed on your system. You can download Python 3 from [<a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">here</a>].
